1. What is an open port?
“An open port is one that’s actively listening for network connections. It means a service or application is running and ready to communicate.”
2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
“Nmap sends a SYN packet to a port. If it gets SYN-ACK back, the port is open. If it gets RST, it’s closed. No reply usually means it’s filtered. It doesn’t finish the handshake, so it’s quick and stealthy.
3. Risks of open ports?
“Open ports can be exploited if the service has vulnerabilities, if credentials are weak, or if malware targets them.
4. TCP vs UDP scanning?
“TCP scanning is connection-based and uses a handshake. UDP scanning is connectionless, slower, and harder to detect because there’s no handshake.
5. Securing open ports?
“Close unused ports, block with a firewall, allow only trusted IPs, use encryption, and keep services updated.
6. Firewall’s role with ports?
“A firewall filters network traffic and decides which ports and services are allowed or blocked.”
7. What is a port scan & why attackers do it?
“A port scan checks which ports are open and listening. Attackers use it to find possible entry points before trying an exploit.”
8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
“Wireshark lets you see the actual packets being sent and received during a scan, so you can confirm responses and spot any unusual activity.”
